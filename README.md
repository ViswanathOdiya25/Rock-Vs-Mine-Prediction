# Rock vs Mine Prediction 🪸⛏️

A machine learning model to classify sonar signal returns as either **rock** or **mine**. This project uses the **Sonar dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a binary classifier using popular ML algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29)
* **Features**: 60 numeric values per instance representing sonar signals.
* **Target**: Two classes – `"R"` (rock) and `"M"` (mine).

## 🚀 Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Preprocessing and normalization
* Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
* Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
* Deployment-ready model saving
* (Optional) Web UI using Flask/Streamlit

## 🧠 ML Models Used

* Logistic Regression

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy Score
  
## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViswanathOdiya25/Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction.git
cd Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook or script:

```bash
jupyter notebook rock_vs_mine.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python app.py
```

## 📈 Sample Output

> Model Accuracy: **95%+** on test data
> High precision in identifying mines (important for safety-critical scenarios)

## 🌐 Deployment (Optional)

You can deploy the trained model using:

* **Flask**
* **Streamlit**
* **Gradio**
* **FastAPI**

## 📌 To-Do

* [ ] Add Docker support
* [ ] Deploy on HuggingFace Spaces or Heroku
* [ ] Add hyperparameter tuning
